## Simple HTTP REST API server code

This repo contains code for a simple CRUD API written in both python (Flask) and javascript (Express). The difference between this repo and the week 2 repo is that this server sconnects to a remote mongo db server.

Both folders also contain a README.md that outlines, step by step, how to get started in the respective language.
